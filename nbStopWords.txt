#nbStopWords.txt

I tried up until 10 but those values of N will just maintain the same accuracy rates

however from 10 and beyond it seems that the accuracy rates tend to go up, just
up until the 10,000 mark where the accuracy starts to dip from there. Thus, I would
conclude that taking out frequent words (stop words) helps the data and the
classifier but taking out too much training data can affect the training phase negatively.
So around 10 to 800 900 ish raised the accuracy rates the most.
