Naive Bayes text classifier ML algorithm used to classify an article as {Liberal, Conservative}. 

nb.py contains main algorithm, nbstopwords, and smoothing incorporate Stop Words and Laplace Smoothing to make for better predictors. 

Laplace smoothing includes adding small epsilons, negligible terms in denominator and numerator to "smooth" out probabilities used 
to predict whether Liberal or Conservative article. Required when log probabilities are used, because log 0 gives us negative probs. 

Stop Words are common articles, words of English language removed from the body of text to predict better based on distinct words. 

Both Naive Bayes programs written use bag-of-words or vocabulary concept to predict the political alignment of article.
