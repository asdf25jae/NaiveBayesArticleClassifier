#topwordsLogOdds.txt

for the topwords Log odds, I found that the words were very different from the
words that were printed in the topwords.py. In fact, there were no overlap
between the two lists (for the two classes) and the words were all very strange
and eccentric such as digby, melissa, loading etc. The main difference was that
these words are not what I would have expected to find because they were all
not very common words.
